# 10e_Crusade_Bot

This project is meant to allow a discord server to act as a central hub for a Warhammer 40k gaming group's crusade.
As online crusades became popular during COVID-19 and many gaming groups found there to be some difficulty in tracking the crusade's progress.
With this Crusade Bot those struggles are over.

## Overview

A server is able to have multiple crusades, within which alliances can be created. Players can join crusades, and attach their orders of battle to an alliance.


## Tips

-All command options are case sensitive!

-There are (currently) __no confirmations for delete and removal commands__, so be careful when using them!
