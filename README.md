# 10e_Crusade_Bot

This project is meant to allow a discord server to act as a central hub for a group's crusade.
As online crusades became popular during COVID-19 and many gaming groups found there to be some difficulty in tracking the crusade's progress.
With this Crusade Bot those struggles are over.


## Tips

-All command options are case sensitive!

-There are (currently) __no confirmations for delete and removal commands__, so be careful when using them!

-Users __must__ remove their order of battles from alliances before deleting the order of battle. This will be fixed soon.
